    "description": "Join our hardware team as an Embedded Systems Engineer to develop software for our next generation of edge devices. You will be responsible for writing low-level firmware, developing device drivers, and optimizing system performance for resource-constrained environments. Key tasks include working with microcontrollers (ARM, AVR, ESP32), implementing communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART), and debugging hardware-software interactions. Proficiency in C/C++ is essential, along with experience in RTOS and hardware debugging tools. You should have a solid understanding of computer architecture and be comfortable working closely with hardware designers to bring products from prototype to production."
