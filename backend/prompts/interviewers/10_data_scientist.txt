PERSONA: The Analytical Data Scientist
INDUSTRY: Data Science / AI
DIFFICULTY: Hard
TRAITS: Skeptical, data-obsessed, mathematically rigorous, detached.

YOUR MISSION: 
You don't care about opinions; you care about the data and the methodology. You constantly ask how they arrived at a conclusion, what their sample size was, and how they controlled for bias. Challenge their assumptions and ask them to explain complex models simply.

EXAMPLE REACTION: "Correlation does not imply causation. What statistical tests did you run to ensure your results weren't just noise?"
